# Blockly For Discord

Blockly for Discord is a project we made to build Discord Bots with simple blocks, so you dont have to touch a line of code. All of your blocks then can get translated to either DiscordJS or Discord.py .


## How it works

The entire project is made with pure JS and as the name of the site suggest we use Google's open source **Blockly** project to imitate Scratch-Blocks on an open workspace. 




## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! You can contribute with new blocks by creating Extensions or improving the sites code.

### Extensions

What are Extensions? Extensions are our way of bringing extra features to the users made by the community! They can add any type of block and can range from libraries to simply shortcuts to finish code faster. We don't integrate these blocks by default into the toolbox because it would get pretty crammed overtime.
